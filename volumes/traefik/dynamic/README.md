# Dynamic Directory
## Description
This directory will store Traefik dynamic config files.  This directory has been specified in the Traefik static config file (`traefik.yml`).  
## Why does this README file exist?
This README.md file was created so this directory will exist in Git repositories (otherwise empty directories are ignored).  When deploying to a remote server this will ensure the directory exists.
